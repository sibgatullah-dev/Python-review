print(len(a)) # length of the string 

# Check string (gives boolean values)
txt = "Objects are closer then they appear"
print("closer" in txt)# itirating through the string to see if the word closer is available int the txt string
print("closer" not in txt)# itirating through the string to see if the word closer is not available int the txt string
